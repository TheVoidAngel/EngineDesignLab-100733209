Individual Assignment 1

My role in my GDW group is mainly game design and some concept/tech art. In this role, I plan to be able to make use of different forms of inspiration to help achieve my vision for the final product. On the art side, I also plan to use these sources of inspiration to create many different mechanical designs as our game is based on mecha warfare. On the design side, I aim to contribute to the design of the game map and the balancing of certain units during the testing phase. Overall, I am prepared to help the group in any way that I am able to regarding these two positions.

	Week 1: During the first week of the lab we were able to successfully implement a form of movement to our character. We achieved this by implementing the use of the Unity Engine Input System which let us use button presses to move the character forward, backward, left, and right. This week was a general learning week where we got used to the interface of unity and how to create and move around objects in the Unity gamespace.

	Week 2: The main focus of this week was collectibles and projectiles. This includes the idea of a scoring system where the player picks up an item and earns a point. In terms of collectibles, we implemented a coin which would be destroyed on contact with the player and then raise the score by one. This could be seen via the console which outputs the new score each time a collectible is picked up. As for projectiles we learned how to make a prefab so that we could make multiple copies of a bullet to shoot out from a prespecified position. We also managed to start an editor camera which we can switch to for editing although no functionality has been implemented yet during the lab.
